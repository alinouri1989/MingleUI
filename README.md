# 🎯 Project Purpose  

This project was initiated as part of the **Computer Networks** course in the **Computer Technologies and Information Systems (CTIS)** department. The goal was to develop a real-time chat application as part of the course.  

Over time, the project was further developed by **Hamza Doğan** and **Nazmi Koçak**, evolving into a more comprehensive application. After an extensive development process, the project was successfully completed on **March 25, 2025**.  

The primary purpose of this project was to help the development team successfully complete the **course** while gaining hands-on experience with a large-scale software implementation.  

Our main objective was to create a **user-friendly, minimalist, and modern real-time chat application** with a smooth and engaging user experience.
